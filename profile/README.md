# Welcome to the INRAE GitHub Organization  

This space hosts public repositories related to software development, scientific dissemination, and research activities involving INRAE (the French National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and Environment). Projects may be developed internally, or in collaboration with external partners.

# Disclaimer  

‚ö†Ô∏è **This GitHub organization is not the official INRAE forge**.  
The official forge of INRAE is [https://forge.inrae.fr](https://forge.inrae.fr), which should be the primary platform for hosting institutional projects.  

This GitHub organization is a complementary space, used when GitHub is specifically justified (e.g., collaborations with numerous external partners who cannot access the INRAE forge, adherences within the GitHub ecosystem, or increased visibility).  

If your project is part of an international research consortium, this one might provide an umbrella under which you could host your projects. See the example of [ELIXIR-Europe](https://github.com/elixir-europe/).

## üîç What repositories are hosted here?  

The repositories in the **INRAE GitHub organization** cover a wide range of topics and use cases, including:  

- Research software developed or maintained by INRAE staff  
- Projects associated with scientific publications  
- Collaborative tools and libraries developed with national or international partners  
- Packages and resources relevant to the scientific community (e.g., R, Python)  
- Mirrors of codebases primarily hosted on other platforms ([INRAE official forge](https://forge.inrae.fr), GitLab, etc.)  

You can browse the full list of repositories [here](./).

## üß≠ Guidelines for publishing a project under this organization  

Repositories can be hosted in the **INRAE GitHub organization** if the following conditions are met:  

- **Institutional relevance**: the project is led or co-led by INRAE staff.  
- **Justified use of GitHub**, for instance:  
  - collaboration with partners outside the RENATER identity federation (foreign researchers, private sector, etc.),  
  - integration within the GitHub ecosystem (e.g., r-universe),  
  - increased visibility or use of GitHub features such as issues or pull requests.  
- **Clear legal and technical framing**: the repository includes a LICENSE file, a README, and mentions of authors/affiliations.  
- **Avoid unnecessary duplication**:  
  - Projects that are already hosted on the INRAE internal forge should not be duplicated on GitHub without a clear justification.  
  - If GitHub visibility is needed (e.g., to attract contributors or manage issues), a **read-only mirror** of the internal repository on GitHub is preferred.  
- **Consortium projects**: for large international collaborations, it may be more appropriate to host code under a consortium-specific GitHub organization (e.g., [ELIXIR-Europe](https://github.com/elixir-europe) for life sciences in Europe).
